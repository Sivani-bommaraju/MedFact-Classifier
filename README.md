🏥 Multilingual Health Misinformation Detection using BERT
📌 Project Overview

The rapid spread of health misinformation online poses a serious public health threat across different languages and cultures. False claims related to diseases, treatments, and vaccines can lead to harmful decisions and societal panic.

This project develops a Multilingual Transformer-based Machine Learning model to automatically detect health-related misinformation across multiple languages including:
* English
* Chinese
* Arabic
* Bulgarian

The system classifies health-related content as:
→ True (Factual Information)
→ False (Misinformation)

The model achieves:

✅ 83.8% Accuracy
✅ Strong F1-score performance
✅ Multilingual capability
